# Chapter 1: Introduction to Financial Management

## 1.1: Finance in Business and in Life

### What is Finance?

**Economy Participants**
|                       | **No Extra Money**            | **Extra Money**              |
| **No Business Ideas** | Type 1: No money and no ideas | Type 2: Money but no ideas   |
| **Business Ideas**    | Type 3: No money but ideas    | Type 4: Both money and ideas |

Type 1 people do not contribute money or spend money in [financial markets](https://google.com), the mechanism by which capital is exchanged.
Type 4 people have ideas and the funds to fund their best ideas. They do not need financial markets.
Type 2 people are the entrepreneurs. They have great ideas but often need more money for *R&D* aka Research and Development.
Type 3 people are your financial institutions like banks or investors. They lend money to the entrepreneurs and take on risk in exchange for returns through interest or ownership claim.

Not all cash is returned to the investors. The financial market system has two sources of friction:

1. *Retained Earnings* : The funds the firm keeps for its ongoing operations.
2. *Taxes* : Costs the government imposes on the company and individuals to help fund public services.

This transfer of funds is a *cash flow* and describes **Finance**.

### Subareas of Finance

- *Investments* is the subarea that has the methods and techinques about what kinds of securities (e.g. bonds or stocks) to buy, which firms' securities to buy, and how to pay back the investor in the requested form.
- *Financial Management* is how the firm manages cash they receive from investors or retained earnings. This involves decisions about:
  - How to organize the firm to attract capital
  - How to raise capital (debt or equity?)
  - Which projects to fund
  - How much capital to retain for operations and projects
  - How to minimize taxation
  - How to pay back investors/loaners
- *Financial Institutions & Markets* are another subarea. They facilitate cash flows between investors and companies. Financial Institutions include banks and pension administrators which play important roles in the dynamic of [interest rates](https://google.com).
- *International Finance* is the study of financial market interactions between different countries. These interactions occur between Investors, companies, business operations, and capital markets which can all be located in different countries. Because of this international dynamic there are new risks that investors have to watch for:
  - Future Exchange Rates
  - Political Risk
  - Changing Business Laws

### Application and Theory for Financial Decisions

*Cash flows are neither instantaneous nor guaranteed.* Future cash flows are uncertain in both timing and size, this uncertainty is referred to as risk. Financial decisions = comparing the rewards vs. risks of potential decisions. A financial asset with a higher expected future value is worth more than one with a lower expected future value. Investors want to get these assets on "sale" aka a better evaluation of expected return than the market's ideas. A firm also wants to fund projects with a higher expected future value.

### Finance vs. Accounting

Both involve the firm's money. Accounting focuses on the past (or history) of the company's money. Finance determines what should happen now and in the future to the firm's money.

## 1.2 The Financial Function

### The Financial Manager

Highest level financial manager = Chief Financial Officer (CFO). They are responsible for:

- Managing cash and credit
- Issuing and repurchasing financial securities such as stocks and bonds.
- Deciding how and when to spend capital for new and existing projects.
- Hedging (reducing the firm's potential risk) against changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
In larger corporations, the controller takes over the accounting functions.

### Finance in Other Business Functions

Finance is involved in the firm beyond just the CFO and his office. It's involved in pretty much every strategic decision that the firm makes in other departments. Operational managers use Finance to determine how much overtime pay to give. Marketing managers use it to evaluate cost-effectiveness in marketing strategies. Human Resources Managers use it to determine the benefits package to offer employees. It's everywhere.

### Finance in Your Personal Life

- Borrowing money to buy a new car
- Refinancing home mortgage to a lower rate
- Making credit card / student loan payments
- Saving for retirement
  - Employers offer defined contribution plans like the 401k and IRAs are self-funded
  - Resulted from tax changes in 1980s

## 1.3 Business Organization

Key questions:

- Who controls the firm
- Who owns the firm
- What are the owners' risks
- What access to capital exists
- What are the tax ramifications

### Sole Proprietorships

Any unincorporated business owned by a single individual. The most common form of business. Easy to Start. Big disadvantage = unlimited liability. This means the owner's assets can get confiscated. Banks and other lenders are not usually willing to lend to this kind of business since there is only one individual to pay back the debt, this makes it hard for them to raise capital.

### Partnerships

Organization with multiple individual owners. The owners split liability and ownership, usually by a percentage of the firm. Profits are added to each partner's personal income and taxed at personal income rates.

### Corporations

A public corporation is a legal entity entirely separate from its owners. It can hold rights and obligations of a persons like owning property, sign binding contracts, and pay taxes. Federal and state governments tax the corporation once at the corporate level. Shareholders (owners) of the corporation are taxed again when corporate profits are paid out as dividends. This is called Double Taxation. Corporations assume liability for their own debts so shareholders aren't exposed to that much risk, this is called limited liability. This allows them to raise a lot of capital because people are more comfortable investing.

### Hybrid Organizations

A combination of both corporation and proprietorship. The U.S. Government allowed this to encourage small business growth. This structure offers limited personal liability to owners while also allowing profits to pass through to owners. This means only single taxation. Examples include *S corporations*, *limited liability partnerships (LLPs)*, and *limited liability companies (LLCs)*. There's also the *limited partnerships (LP)* which also have *general partners* that benefit from single taxation as well but must assume personal liability.

## 1.4 Firm Goals

Two schools of thought on what the goal of firm should be. One is to maximize *shareholder* wealth. The other is to maximize *stakeholder* wealth which includes everyone involved in the well-being of the company, not just the shareholders. The latter school of thought emphasizes social responsibility.
Adam Smith, a famous economist, is commonly referenced in the first school of thought. He argues that self-serving people will benefit the economy through the invisible hand, the mechanisms by which the market works. Profit maximization = what the market needs = what the world needs = better success for all. The measure of wealth of this theory is the stock price.
For stakeholder theory some alternative measurements they choose over stock price. Some alternatives include maximizing net income/profit, minimizing costs, and maximizing market share. Each of these has shortcomings. Maximizing net income/profit means choosing a quarter, a corporation may be incentivized to inflate a profit for the evaluation quarter to the detriment of the future. For minimizing costs or maximizing market share might make employees very happy but that might also mean spending no money on R&D costs which can be detrimental to the company's future. No company survives long without investing in the future. You can always increase market share by lowering price but that could drive your firm out of business as you don't make enough to pay the costs.

## 1.5 Agency Theory

### Agency Problem

Stockholders hire managers to run the firm. Ideally, managers run the firm perfectly to maximize shareholder equity value. However, managers may be incentivised to act in their own interests. Like buying an expensive car on company dime when the decision to maximize equity value would be to spend that money in reinvesting back into the corporation. This conflict of interest is called the Agency Problem.
How do we minimize this conflict of interest?

1. Ignore such expenses if it's relatively small to corporate cash flow. May actually boost productivity.
2. Monitor manager's actions (usually via auditing). This can be prohibitively expensive. Also only larger shareholders are incentivised to monitor.
3. Make managers owners. As equity increases so does manager benefits.

### Corporate Governance

The process of monitoring managers and aligning their goals with shareholder goals is known as Corporate Governance. Shareholders are not very involved in the firm's operations. Too little investment and too much time committment for the average joe. How to monitor managers effectively so they act in shareholders' best interests? Answer: shareholder appointed board of directors. There are also outside 3rd parties. Auditors make sure firms aren't breaking the law. Investment analysts inform the investment community of their own analysis of a company. Investment Banks provide access to capital markets, advise managers on how to interact with said markets, and monitor firm performance. Credit Analysts evaluate the firm's financial strength for its debt holders. Finally, the government monitors business activities through the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

### The Role of Ethics

Ethics is very important in Finance because professionals manage other people's money. Unethical decisions = acting in their own interests over shareholders' = money stolen. Professional associations place a strong emphasis on ethical behavior, set standards, and provide training.

## 1.6 Financial Markets, Intermediaries, and the Firm

Financial institutions make money by offering their unique assets and expertise. They offer these when other people pay them to help facilitate the decisions / exchanges in markets.

## 1.7 Big Picture Environment

It's important for financial managers to include factors outside their own firms in making financial decisions. Inflation rates or currency exchange rates between countries can make a previously good project a poor investment. Factors outside the individual firm are referred to as factors in the big picture environment. Two recent factors in the picture environment (in the US) are the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 and the Covid-19 Pandemic. The idea of the TCJA was that by reducing effective tax rates for most people and corporations the extra money would *trickle down* into the economy. More money in economy = more businesses and business growth = more taxes for government = better public services = win. However, the Covid-19 Pandemic caused a demand shock. Suddenly people weren't able to pay the taxes yet government services were needed more than ever. This means that the TCJA provisions set to expire in 2025 may be repealed sooner.

### Reductions in Individual Income Tax Rates

Notice how the "break point" for both types of tax filers have changed as a result of TCJA. The result is that most taxpayers will pay less taxes.

Some other information about TCJA that a Financial decision maker would factor into their decision:

- TCJA eliminated or restricted many itemized deductions (individual tax deductions people could claim) and instead raised the standard deduction (a set amount you can deduct from your income). Taxpayers are now less likely to claim individual deductions.
- State and Local tax deduction is capped to $10,000.
- Mortgage interest is still deductible but only the first $750,000. This is a big deal for areas with high real estate costs.
- Interest on home equity loans are no longer deductible.

What does all of this mean? We can expect more free cash for expenditures for consumers, more savings for investors, and slight decline in housing sales in high-value markets.

### Corporate Tax Rates Reduced

Previous tax law made corporations pay taxes at a graduated (bracketed) income rate. This means the more a corporation made the higher proportion of taxes they paid. The rates were 15%, 25%, 34%, and 35%. Personal Service Corporations (PSCs) paid a flat 35% rate. The result was that many corporations moved outside of the US to avoid these high tax rates. The TCJA established a flat 21% tax rate with the goal of bringing those overseas profits back to the US.

### New Deduction for "Pass-Through" Business Income

Previous law taxed sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs, and S Corporations as "pass-through" entities. Basically net taxable income from these entities were simply passed through to their owners and taxed at the owner level at standard rates. TCJA created a new deduction based on the entity owner's (or owners') *qualified business income* (QBI). This deduction usually amounted to 20% of the QBI. This deduction is applied to taxable income ONLY not to the adjusted gross income (AGI). For reference, AGI - deductions or standard rate = taxable income. Deductibles like retirement and student loan interest depends on the AGI, this method of deducting only on taxable income ensures that only the business receives this benefit. The result is that said entities get similar benefits to corporations, encouraging small business creation and growth.

### Liberalized Asset Expensing and Depreciation Provisions

The TCJA also added changes in tax laws to immediately deduct (expense) costs of certain assets in the year they are purchased rather than depreciating those costs over time. Expensing means the business can deduct the full cost of an asset in the year it is purchased instead of depreciating those costs over time. This is beneficial for cash flow because it reduces taxable income immediately which lowers taxes in the year of purchase. Liberalized provisions are rules that make the laws more generous. This allows businesses to expense more types of assets or larger amounts than before. For example higher limits on the total amount of purchases that can be expensed or more flexibility in which assets can be fully expensed in the first year.

TCJA does this several ways:

- The maximum section 179 deduction is increased to 1,000,000 from 510,000 for property placed in service after 2017.
- The first year bonus depreciation for property is increased to 100% from 50%. It's scheduled to decline by 20% from 2023 until the bonus percent is 0 after 2026. This is to encourage temporary investment in new and qualifying property.
- New and used passenger vehicles in service after 2017 and used over 50% of the time for business the maximum depreciation deductions are now:
  - $10,000 for year 1 ($11,160 for new car and $3,160 for used before)
  - $16,000 for year 2 ($5,100)
  - $9,600 for year 3 ($3,050)
  - $5,760 for year 4 and after until the vehicle is fully depreciated ($1,875)

As a financial decision maker, you could reasonably expect an increase in companies' depreciable assets/investments as a result of these new provisions.

### New Limits on Business Interest Deductions

Prior to TCJA Business could deduct the full amount of interest they paid on loans or other debts. TCJA created a new rule that says you can't deduct interest expenses more than 30% of a businesses adjusted taxable income. For special entities like LLCs and S Corps, this amount is at the business level rather than the owner level. Businesses also can't calculate adjusted taxable income by adding back allowable deductions in depreciation, amortization, and depletion anymore. The result of these policies is that businesses with high leverage (high debt) can't deduct large interest expenses from taxable income. This prevents businesses from just borrowing a ton of money to grow while dodging taxes.

### Stricter Rules for Deducting Losses

After 2017, the amount of Net Operating Losses (NOL) that can offset taxable income was reduced from 100% to 80%. NOLs cannot be carried back but they can be carried forward indefinitely. Not being able to be carried back means businesses can't rely on a tax refund to boost their cash flow in the short term. Before, carrying back NOLs meant a lower taxable income which meant that you retroactively paid more taxes and were therefore eligible for a refund. On the bright side, since TCJA allows businesses to infinitely carry forward, this allows high growth businesses to leverage a lot of debt to grow. The NOL refunds will be smaller which means small businesses can't leverage as much cash flow but they do have more time to utilize this benefit. Smaller benefit over a longer time.

### Reduced or Eliminated Deductions for Business Entertainment and Some Employee Benefits

TCJA no longer allows Businesses to deduct Business entertainment expenses such as company dinners or social events. Many of these fringe benefits were deductible by the employer and tax-free to the employee. Now, only meal expenses while traveling on business are deductible at 50%. The goal of these changes was to reduce employer incentives to provide business-related entertainment or to subsidize employee commuting expenses.

### Change to R&D Expense Deduction

R&D expenses must be capitalized and amortized over 5 years or 15 years if R&D is outside the United States. This is instead of being deducted completely under current tax law. The goal of this policy is to slightly reduce amounts spent on R&D by U.S. businesses as they have to budget taxes on R&D instead of having it all deducted up front.
