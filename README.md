# Core Features for Your Finance App

## Introduction to Finance Module

**Objective**: Create a section that explains the key objectives and roles of financial managers. This can be an informational page or interactive quiz.

**Concepts**: Corporate finance, investments, financial markets.

**Implementation**: A simple dashboard where users can read explanations and participate in short quizzes on these topics.

## Financial Statement Analysis Tool

**Objective**: Allow users to input financial data and evaluate a company’s financial health.

**Concepts**: Balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement.

**Implementation**:
- Users can input financial statement data (e.g., assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses).
- App generates key financial ratios (like liquidity ratios, profitability ratios) and visualizes them (with graphs).
- Use a backend calculator for ratio analysis and comparison with industry averages.

**Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend**: React or Vue.js for input forms and displaying results.
- **Backend**: Python/Node.js for ratio calculation logic.
- **Data visualization**: Chart.js or Recharts (if you're familiar with Recharts).

## Financial Mathematics Module

**Objective**: Help users compute various financial scenarios using time value of money (TVM) concepts.

**Concepts**: Present value (PV), future value (FV), annuities, compounding interest.

**Implementation**:
- Users can input values (e.g., interest rate, period, amount) and select a scenario (e.g., FV of an investment).
- App computes and displays results, showing users how the TVM works over time.

**Example**:

```python
def future_value(principal, rate, time):
    return principal * (1 + rate) ** time
```

## Financial Instruments & Markets Module

**Objective**: Teach users the characteristics of bonds, stocks, and derivatives. Include interactive features to illustrate how prices change.

**Concepts**: Bonds, stocks, derivatives, pricing.

**Implementation**:
- A bond pricing calculator: Let users enter coupon rates, maturity, and interest rates to see how bond prices fluctuate.
- A stock pricing tool using simple dividend models (e.g., dividend discount model).

**Example for bond pricing**:

```python
def bond_price(face_value, coupon_rate, periods, market_rate):
    coupon = face_value * coupon_rate
    return sum([coupon / (1 + market_rate) ** i for i in range(1, periods + 1)]) + face_value / (1 + market_rate) ** periods
```

---

## Risk and Return Calculator

**Objective**: Explain and calculate the risk-return tradeoff using CAPM.

**Concepts**: Risk, return, CAPM.

**Implementation**:
- Create a CAPM calculator: Users input risk-free rate, beta, and expected market return. The app calculates the required rate of return.
- You can also add an interactive graph to show the relationship between risk and return.

**CAPM Formula**:

```python
def capm(risk_free_rate, beta, market_return):
    return risk_free_rate + beta * (market_return - risk_free_rate)
```

---

## Financing Decisions and WACC

**Objective**: Let users compute a company’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

**Concepts**: Debt, equity, cost of capital, WACC.

**Implementation**:
- Input debt, equity, cost of debt, and cost of equity. The app calculates WACC and explains how it's used for project evaluations.

**WACC Example**:

```python
def wacc(debt, equity, cost_of_debt, cost_of_equity, tax_rate):
    total_value = debt + equity
    wacc_value = (debt / total_value) * cost_of_debt * (1 - tax_rate) + (equity / total_value) * cost_of_equity
    return wacc_value
```

---

## Investment Analysis Tool

**Objective**: Evaluate investment projects using metrics like NPV, IRR, and payback period.

**Concepts**: NPV, IRR, payback period.

**Implementation**:
- Users input cash flows and discount rates. The app calculates NPV and IRR, and outputs whether the project is desirable.

**Example for NPV**:

```python
def npv(discount_rate, cash_flows):
    return sum([cf / (1 + discount_rate) ** i for i, cf in enumerate(cash_flows)])
```

You can also add an IRR calculator using numerical methods to find the rate at which NPV equals zero.

## Tools and Technology Stack

### Frontend:
- Use React for creating interactive forms and dashboards.
- Bootstrap or Material UI for styling.

### Backend:
- Python or Node.js to handle financial calculations.
- Flask or Django can be used if you prefer a backend framework.

### Database (optional):
- If you need to store user input or session data, use SQLite or PostgreSQL.

### Data Visualization:
- Chart.js or Recharts for graphs showing financial data (e.g., stock price changes, cash flow charts, etc.).

### Deployment:
- Use Heroku or AWS for quick deployment of your web app.

## Organization
Add new routes to the routes/ folder.
Use services/finance_calculations.py to handle more complex financial logic, like NPV, WACC, etc., for future modules.
Write unit tests for each route under the tests/ directory.
